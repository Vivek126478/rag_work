Provider Limits Encountered:

Google AI: Rate limits on free tier required careful error handling and retry logic

Pinecone: Free tier has limitations on index size and operations

Cohere: Free tier has daily request limits for the reranking API

What I Would Do Next:

Enhanced Chunking: Implement semantic chunking that respects document structure and content boundaries

Authentication: Implement user authentication and document isolation

Additional File Support: Add support for more document types (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, web pages)

Monitoring: Add proper logging, monitoring, and analytics
